This project was created using AI and ML as a part of Mini project for IT Engineering.

“Real Time Object Detection” project detects objects efficiently based on the YOLO algorithm and applies the algorithm on image data and video data to detect objects. The objective is to detect and track the generic object in real time. In real life, therefore, we require rich information about the surrounding. We need to understand how the objects are moving with respect to the camera. It would also help to recognize the interaction between objects. For example, in the case of the self-driving car the knowledge about the interaction between the pedestrians will help to predict the pedestrian behavior accurately. This prediction will eventually help the self-driving car to make intelligent choices on a crowded road. To make a ML project on Real Time Object Detection with the best algorithm such that the project focuses on accuracy of the output, detection of 10 classes or as much as we can.
